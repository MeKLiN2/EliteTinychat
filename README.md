# EliteTinychat for Ublock Origins
a script to block every single thing other than the chat, surprisingly , no one cared enough to make this and offer it to the community
this includes many hiden javascript , pixel tracker, ip logger, from 7-10 microsoft / twitter / google tier pages that slow ur chat down

there are things a person who pm and dont use a bot to read the chat / or arent in a pm with their bot at all times should do
it says where, to reenable PMs, or any other things, add a ! before the line. u also will need to turn it off to change cam, nickname, mic. if cams dont load, refresh until get captcha or find out which DIV i blocked that is related to 'notify' bar which is the annoying bar popup that shows pms and button to load cams if u arent wise enough to do captcha when joining chat by refreshing a few times.

if u are on opera ubuntu u may crash if adding this extension from the opera store, use chrome store.

furthermore, do not use CTS script. it has hidden eventListener on PM which activate stealth ad clicker
